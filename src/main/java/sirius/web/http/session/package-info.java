/**
 * Server sided session handling.
 * <p>
 * Provides a framework for managing and storing server sided sessions. By default all sessions are stored
 * as conventional {@link java.util.Map} object in the heap.
 * <p>
 * Alternative storage engines might be added by
 * providing an implementation of {@link sirius.web.http.session.SessionStorage}.
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle management with a two step timeout is provided by the framework. Therefore short lived sessions,
 * like those created by a search engine crawling the site are reclaimed pretty quickly to maintain server
 * stability. (Read more here: {@link sirius.web.http.session.ServerSession})
